# Gender_Prediction

The project aims to predict a person's gender based on the content of a text written by that person.

Neural networks were trained by merging five different datasets:
1. Texts written in personal diaries
2. Texts related to newspaper articles
3. Twitter comments
4. Youtube comments
5. Texts written by children

The embedding used is either created directly in code through Keras or loaded from already trained templates such as Word2Vec.
